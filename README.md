# FS2017-silo-cleaner
A program editing FS2017 savegame files to fix a common bug - inability to completely empty a silage silo. 

In order for this program to work, a save has to have a standard name "Savegame1", and for safety issues it is good to have it backed up.
These inconveniences are going to be eliminated in the upcoming version.
